        <em>A "professional newspaper for all the things me :D</em>
        <h2>15. 6. 2020 - I WAS WRONG</h2>
        <p>At first I thought that it would not happen.
            How naive ...
            I should have been able to deduce that the fact that this can happen is bad.
            Thankfully I have learned my lesson and now know what I ought to do next time :D</div>

        <h2>12. 6. 2020 - MISSION</h2>
        <p>I am on a mission. It is indeed learning a new skill - <strong>dancing</strong>. Why have I chosen dancing?
            Well it's simple, I will explain it to you if I don't give up on it!
            Don't worry, the likelyhood that that happens if very low, close to 1% :D
